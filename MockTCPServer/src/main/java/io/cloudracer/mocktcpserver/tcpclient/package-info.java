/**
 * TCPClient is provided primarily to facilitate demonstration of the {@link io.cloudracer.mocktcpserver.MockTCPServer MockTCPServer}, and for use in test suites.
 * <p>
 * The TCPClient sends a message to a specified Machine, on a specified port, and waits for a synchronous response. This behavior, and <b>much more is configurable</b> so that the TCPClient can be used in as wide a variety of test suites as possible.
