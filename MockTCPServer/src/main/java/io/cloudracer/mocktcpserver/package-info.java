/**
 * MockTCPServer simulates a TCP Server in environments where the *real* server is not available. The *real* TCP Server may still be in development but you need to continue developing the integrations with other systems. Perhaps installing and configuring one or more Enterprise Application in a System Test environment is prohibitively time consuming and/or costly.
 * <p>
 * MockTCPServer has a number of features specifically designed for Integration/System testing. No particular Test Framework is preferred or required.
 * <p>
 * Source code is made available, under an Open Source <a href="https://github.com/CloudRacer/MockTCPServer/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">licence</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/CloudRacer/MockTCPServer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. <a href="http://mocktcpserver.cloudracer.io/docs/api/" target="_blank">Javadocs</a> are currently very limited and quite sparse but they will be improved with each release.

 * More information is available on the <a href="http://mocktcpserver.cloudracer.io/">MockTCPServer</a> home page.
