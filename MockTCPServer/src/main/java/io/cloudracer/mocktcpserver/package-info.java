/**
 * MockTCPServer simulates a TCP Server in environments where the <b>real</b> server is not available. The <b>real</b> TCP Server may still be in development but you need to continue developing the integrations with other systems. Perhaps installing and configuring one or more Enterprise Applications in a System Test environment is prohibitively time consuming and/or costly.
 * <p>
 * MockTCPServer has a number of features specifically designed for Integration/System testing. No particular Test Framework is preferred or required.
 * <p>
 * Source code is made available, under an Open Source <a href="https://github.com/CloudRacer/MockTCPServer/blob/master/LICENSE.md">licence</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/CloudRacer/MockTCPServer">GitHub</a>. <a href="http://mocktcpserver.cloudracer.io/docs/api/">Javadocs</a> are available for the latest version and each previous release.
