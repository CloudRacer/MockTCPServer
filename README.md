**MockTCPServer** simulates a TCP Server in environments where the *real* server is not available, or it connects to other systems that are not available. MockTCPServer has a number of features specifically designed for Unit/Integration/System testing. No particular Test Framework is preferred or required.

Sometimes, installing and configuring one or more enterprise application in a System Test environment is simply not worth it. Of course, the *real* TCP Server may still be in development but work on dependant systems must continue.
